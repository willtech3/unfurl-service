    Freezes a list of dictionaries containing lists of strings.

    This function takes a list of dictionaries where the values are lists of strings and converts it into
    a frozen set of frozen sets of frozen dictionaries. This is done by iterating over the input list,
    converting each dictionary's values (lists of strings) into frozen sets of strings, and then
    converting the resulting dictionary into a frozen dictionary. Finally, all these frozen dictionaries
    are collected into a frozen set of frozen sets.

    This operation is useful when you want to ensure the immutability of the data structure and make it
    hashable, which is required for certain operations like using it as a key in a dictionary or as an
    element in a set.

    Example: [{"TestAuth": ["test", "test1"]}]
