# Multi-stage Dockerfile for Instagram unfurl service with Playwright

# Build Stage: Use official Playwright image for browser installation
# =====================================================
# Using the official Playwright image ensures compatibility and includes all
# necessary system dependencies (apt-get, etc.) for browser installation
